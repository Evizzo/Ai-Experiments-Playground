Answer: The Zygons had invaded Earth once more.

-- Graph-only Retrieval --
Answer: The Zygon invasion, a recurring threat in the Doctor Who universe, typically involves the Zygons, a race of shapeshifting aliens, infiltrating Earth society by replacing key individuals. They maintain their true form within specialized pods or stasis chambers, often hidden in plain sight. The invasion is usually subtle, with Zygons mimicking humans to gain positions of power and influence, destabilizing society from within. Their ultimate goal is often to terraform Earth into a more Zygon-friendly environment, potentially at the expense of humanity. The Doctor and his companions are usually the only ones who can uncover the deception and stop the Zygons before their plans come to fruition. The invasion often involves a complex web of paranoia, mistrust, and the challenge of identifying who is truly human and who is a Zygon imposter.

Answer: The Zygon invasion was a subtle, insidious creep. It wasn't a frontal assault of spaceships and laser fire, but a slow, creeping replacement. The Zygons, masters of mimicry, had infiltrated every level of society. They weren't just soldiers; they were politicians, teachers, police officers, even friends and family.

Their true forms, grotesque and orange, were hidden beneath perfect human disguises, maintained by advanced technology and a chilling lack of empathy. They moved amongst humanity, observing, learning, and subtly manipulating events to their advantage.

The invasion wasn't about conquest in the traditional sense. It was about assimilation. The Zygons sought to replace humanity, to make Earth their new home, a planet populated by Zygons wearing human faces. They exploited human weaknesses, sowing discord and distrust, making it easier to slip into the cracks and take control.

Unit, ever vigilant, had detected anomalies, strange energy signatures and behavioral inconsistencies. They were prepared for a fight, for a conventional war. But the Zygons weren't playing by those rules. They were already inside, a silent, invisible enemy, waiting for the opportune moment to fully reveal their presence and claim Earth as their own. The invasion was a slow burn, a chilling realization that the person standing next to you might not be who they seemed, and that the world you knew was slowly, irrevocably changing.
